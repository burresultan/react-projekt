# MovieWatch
MovieWatch is a Movie library that provides users with information about movies. As a user you are able to:
- Search for Movies from the API

The Movies are extracted from [TMDb's API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).


# Installing
To run this app you need to install
- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/#download)


To run the app you need to create an account to get an API key from [TMDb](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).
Once you've got the API key you need to create a file called ``key.json`` in the ``src`` folder

# React vs Angular & Vue

## Why we chose React over Angular & Vue
### React
- React is the most popular frontend framework
- React is easier to learn and use
- React offers fast rendering
- Has a strong community support (eg. Youtube & StackOverflow)
- React lets us re-use elements in different components
- React has a third-party CLI tool called ``create-react-app`` which creates the react project quckly.

### Angular
- Angular is harder to learn and use
- Angular has less npm downloads than React
- Angular has a smaller community, which makes it harder to find solutions to problems
- Angular has more questions tagged than React in Stackoverflow, despite being less used
- Angular has a longer ramp-up time, because it's more complex than React


### Vue
- Vue has a smaller community support
- Makes it harder to find solutions to problems online
- Vue has a lot less npm package downloads than React
- Vue is less popular for mobile/cross-platform solutions
- Vue view layers are built different, uses HTML templates but option to write in JSX.
- React on the other hand solely uses JSX
